# DifferentialEvolution
Differential evolution code from masters 2005

The file test.cc refers to two file pedsimDirectory.dat and differential_equation.dat.

Each file contains a single line which is a full directory path.
The pedsim directory refers to a directory containing pedestrian simulation software.
This software is run by test.cc and its output helps determine the fitness of an individual or candidate solution.
The differential equation directory is the output directory for the algorithm (i think, should have written it down somewhere).
